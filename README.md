### compoundedWordFinder (java program):
#### The program uses a Trie data structure to efficiently store and search for words in the input list.
#### The program prints the following information to the console:
    Longest compounded word
    Second longest compounded word
    Time taken to process the input file
    Error Handling

#### steps to execute code:
##### Step 1: Open a command prompt or terminal on your computer and navigate to the Directory.
You can also use any code editor (like vs code).


##### Step 2: Compile and run the program.

##### Note: Ensure you have the input files Input_01.txt and Input_02.txt in the same directory as your Java source code file (CompoundedWordFinder.java). These files should contain the alphabetically sorted list of words, one word per line, in lowercase.
##### Also, program uses input file Input_01.txt by default. For input file Input_02.txt; we have to manually cange the file name in program and then save the progran and now it will run for Input_02.txt.
